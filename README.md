Challenges
==========

My attempts at completing various challenges from:

- [CodeChef](https://codechef.com)
- [/r/DailyProgrammer](https://reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer)

## Software

- CodeChef solutions are developed using Python (v3.4),
  and are simply scripts without external dependencies
  that take input from `stdin` and output to `stdout`.
  
  The [README in `/codechef`](https://github.com/bilalakil/challenges/tree/master/codechef/README.md)
  contains instructions on executing the scripts via Docker,
  to help keep environments consistent.

- /r/DailyProgrammer solutions are written in Haskell (v8),
  and are simply scripts without external dependences
  that take input from `stdin` and output to `stdout`.

  The solutions are accompanied by HUnit test scripts,
  which have a singular dependency: HUnit.

  The [README in `/dailyprogrammer`](https://github.com/bilalakil/challenges/tree/master/dailyprogrammer/README.md)
  contains instructions on executing the scripts and their tests via Docker,
  to avoid dependency management (which is necessary for testing)
  and to help keep environments consistent.

## Other

- In time-sensitive challenges (like those from CodeChef),
  the code may have been cleaned up before being committed,
  and thus may differ from what was submitted in the challenge.
